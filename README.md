# Dublin-Rental-Data

This repository contains a complete data science workflow focused on **data collection** and **preparation**. The project includes structured notebooks for scraping data, cleaning it, and performing initial analysis â€” laying the groundwork for further machine learning or visualization work.

## ðŸ—‚ Project Structure

- `Data Collection.ipynb`:  
  This notebook contains the code and methodology used to collect raw data. It likely includes web scraping, API calls, or file parsing.
  
- `Data Preparation and Analysis.ipynb`:  
  This notebook processes the collected data â€” cleaning, normalizing, transforming, and conducting preliminary exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Run the notebooks:
   You can open the notebooks in JupyterLab or VSCode and run the cells step by step.

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib / seaborn (for visualization)
- requests / BeautifulSoup4 (for web scraping)
- PowerBI

> Note: Install additional packages depending on the specific data sources and formats used.

## ðŸ“ˆ Outputs

- Cleaned CSVs or DataFrames ready for ML or visualization
- Summary statistics
- Data quality checks (missing values, type conversion, etc.)
- Interactive PowerBI Dashboard
